        <p>Prior to his time in the professional scene, Lowry had been playing college basketball at Villanova University in Pennsylvania for the Villanova Wildcats.
          He started off playing for the Grizzlies in 2006 and continued with them up until 2009 when he was traded to the Houston Rockets.
          It wasnâ€™t until another 3 years later in 2012 when he joined the team he would call home for the next 9 years, the Toronto Raptors.</p>

        <p>In his last year of playing for the Toronto Raptors Kyle recorded his 4000th assist with the team being one of only 3 players to have over 4000 on their current team.
          Just shy of 2 weeks after this event he reached yet another milestone achieving 10,000 points with the team again being only 1 of 3 to achieve this while on the Toronto Raptors.
          After 9 years of playing for the Toronto Raptors, reaching these milestones and acquiring the first ever NBA championship for the team in its franchise history, Lowry would be traded off to Miami.
          On August 6 2021 Kyle was traded off to the Miami Heat.</p>
