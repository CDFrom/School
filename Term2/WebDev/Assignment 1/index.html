      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Colin I am 25 years old and I was born and raised in Calgary,
        Alberta, Canada. I am currently studying to become a software developer
        at Bow Valley College in their Software Development Diploma program. I
        first got into the idea of doing software development back around middle
        school, but my mind kept changing as to what I wanted to do for a career
        path. Over the years I took many different jobs in a variety of fields
        and even set out into the trades for a while working as a steamfitter.
        One day I decided that I wanted to follow my passion of coding and
        working with computers and set out to figure out how I was going to make
        it happen. I am currently in my second year at Bow Valley and couldn't
        be happier with my choice to pursue becoming a computer programmer.
